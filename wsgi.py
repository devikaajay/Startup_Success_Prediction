import sys
# Adjust this path to match your project structure if app.py is not in the root
# For Colab, we're assuming app.py is in the root, so no path adjustment is strictly needed
# but for PythonAnywhere, this will be crucial.
# Example: path = '/home/your_username/your_project_name'

# We'll put a placeholder here, the user will need to update this on PythonAnywhere.
# If app.py is in the root, the current directory will usually be in sys.path.
